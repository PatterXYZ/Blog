About Me
========

* I am a postgraduate from China.
* I enjoy making sound using computer, especially in the fields of sound programming, sound synthesis and algorithmic composition.
* Unfortunately, I am not a professional programmer, I have just started learning Python as my first computer language recently.
* So, I hope I can learn and discuss about programming with you guys here.
