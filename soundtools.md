## SoundTools
#####a toolset for sound design under Linux

I'm trying to make sound under Linux. But I found it doesn't meet all my needs in some way, though there are already a lot of packs for it. So, I'm here trying to start a project to write some simple scripts solving some small problems so as to use open source softwares better for making sound. Actually, I started to learn Python which is my first computer language from yesterday. So, if you are interested in this project, please help me to improve it in some way.
